By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

Pull requests against the generated content will be closed.

## Creating an Issue

Before you create a new issue:

We can't accept requests for new AWS service features or changes to existing
features in this repository. If you have a feature request, please use the
[AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/) to create a
new support case, or use the "Feedback" button in the AWS Management Console or
the relevant AWS service documentation. If you have access to an AWS Technical
Account Manager, you can also discuss your feature request with them.

If you have a question about how to use an AWS service, you can ask for help on
[AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/),
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/amazon-web-services),
the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/), or in
the GitHub discussion forums for the relevant AWS SDK, located in that SDK's
repository.

Please **do** file an issue if you think you've found a bug in the generated
models - that is, if the models don't match the service's API documentation.

1. Please ensure there is not already an
[open issue](https://github.com/aws/api-models-aws/issues) for the same problem.
2. Include a code snippet that demonstrates the problem, if you can.
3. Include a link to the relevant section of the service's API documentation.
4. Anything you've tried to work around the issue yourself.
5. Anything unusual about your environment or deployment.

## Security issue notifications
If you discover a potential security issue in this project we ask that you
